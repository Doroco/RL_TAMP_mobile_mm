    /*!
            This class represents an approximation of the reachability distribution of a kinematic chain (e.g. an arm).
            Consists of voxels covering the 6D space for position (XYZ) and orientation (Taitï¿½Bryan angles, EulerXYZ, static frame).
            Each voxel holds a counter with the number of successful IK solver calls,
            representing the approximated probability that an IK solver call can be successfully answered.
            The discretized reachability data can be written to and loaded from binary files.

            The reachability is linked to a base coordinate system which is defined by a robot joint.
            This base system is used to align the data when the robot is moving.
            I.E. think of an arm of a humanoid where the reachability is linked to the shoulder.
            When the torso moves, the reachability also changes it's position according to the position of the shoulder.
